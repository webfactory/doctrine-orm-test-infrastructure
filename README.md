doctrine-orm-test-infrastructure
================================

![Tests](https://github.com/webfactory/doctrine-orm-test-infrastructure/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

This library provides some infrastructure for tests of Doctrine ORM entities, featuring:

- configuration of a SQLite in memory database, compromising well between speed and a database environment being both
  realistic and isolated
- a mechanism for importing fixtures into your database that circumvents Doctrine's caching. This results in a more
  realistic test environment when loading entities from a repository.

[We](https://www.webfactory.de/) use it to test Doctrine repositories and entities in Symfony applications. It's a
lightweight alternative to the
heavyweight [functional tests suggested in the Symfony documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/testing/doctrine.html)
(we don't suggest you should skip those - we just want to open another path).

In non-application bundles, where functional tests are not possible,
it is our only way to test repositories and entities.

Installation
------------

Install via composer (see http://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require --dev webfactory/doctrine-orm-test-infrastructure

Usage
-----

```php
<?php

use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;
use Entity\MyEntity;
use Entity\MyEntityRepository;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use Webfactory\Doctrine\ORMTestInfrastructure\ORMInfrastructure;

class MyEntityRepositoryTest extends TestCase
{
    private ORMInfrastructure $infrastructure;
    private MyEntityRepository $repository;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        /*
           This will create an in-memory SQLite database with the necessary schema
           for the MyEntity entity class and and everything reachable from it through
           associations.
        */
        $this->infrastructure = ORMInfrastructure::createWithDependenciesFor(MyEntity::class);
        $this->repository = $this->infrastructure->getRepository(MyEntity::class);
    }

    /**
     * Example test: Asserts imported fixtures are retrieved with findAll().
     */
    public function testFindAllRetrievesFixtures(): void
    {
        $myEntityFixture = new MyEntity();

        $this->infrastructure->import($myEntityFixture);
        $entitiesLoadedFromDatabase = $this->repository->findAll();

        /* 
            import() will use a dedicated entity manager, so imported entities do not
            end up in the identity map. But this also means loading entities from the
            database will create _different object instances_.

            So, this does not hold:
        */
        // self::assertContains($myEntityFixture, $entitiesLoadedFromDatabase);

        // But you can do things like this (you probably want to extract that in a convenient assertion method):
        self::assertCount(1, $entitiesLoadedFromDatabase);
        $entityLoadedFromDatabase = $entitiesLoadedFromDatabase[0];
        self::assertSame($myEntityFixture->getId(), $entityLoadedFromDatabase->getId());
    }

    /**
     * Example test for retrieving Doctrine's entity manager.
     */
    public function testSomeFancyThingWithEntityManager(): void
    {
        $entityManager = $this->infrastructure->getEntityManager();
        // ...
    }
}
```

Migrating to attribute-based mapping configuration (with version 1.x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In versions 1.x of this library, the `ORMInfrastructure::createWithDependenciesFor()` and `ORMInfrastructure::createOnlyFor()` methods
by default assume that the Doctrine ORM mapping is provided through annotations. Annotations-based configuration is no supported anymore in ORM 3.0.

To allow for a seamless transition towards attribute-based or other types of mapping, a mapping driver can be passed
when creating instances of the `ORMInfrastructure`.

If you wish to switch to attribute-based mappings, pass a `new \Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Driver\AttributeDriver($paths)`,
where `$paths` is an array of directory paths where your entity classes are stored.

For hybrid (annotations and attributes) mapping configurations, you can use `\Doctrine\Persistence\Mapping\Driver\MappingDriverChain`.
Multiple mapping drivers can be registered on the driver chain by providing namespace prefixes. For every namespace prefix,
only one mapping driver can be used.

Starting in version 2.0.0, attributes-based mapping will be the default.

Testing the library itself
--------------------------

After installing the dependencies managed via composer, just run

    vendor/bin/phpunit

from the library's root folder. This uses the shipped phpunit.xml.dist - feel free to create your own phpunit.xml if you
need local changes.

Happy testing!

Known Issues
------------

Please note that apart from any [open issues in this library](https://github.com/webfactory/doctrine-orm-test-infrastructure/issues), you
may stumble upon any Doctrine issues. Especially take care of
it's [known sqlite issues](http://doctrine-dbal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/known-vendor-issues.html#sqlite).
